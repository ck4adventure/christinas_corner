# Christinas Corner

### Getting Started
Once cloned:
From the root create a venv environment, python 3.12.0 for now.
Once activated, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, which installs tools needed.
`cd app` or just remember to use `app/manage.py`.  
`python manage.py migrate`  
`python manage.py runserver`  

Currently no homepage but /recipes should return a response.
